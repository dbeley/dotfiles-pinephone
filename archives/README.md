- autostart: autostart gammastep
- gammastep: automatically change color temperature (features is now native in phosh)

## Distros

I have tried several distros, here are some thoughts:

- Archlinux ARM (https://github.com/dreemurrs-embedded/Pine64-Arch)
    - installer allows for full-disk encryption
	- lots of config to do by hand (hence the scripts)
	- repos have almost everything
	- docking mode needs a reboot from time to time
	- best all-around
- Mobian
	- docking mode is hit or miss
	- repos lack `gnome-podcasts`
	- very stable
- PostmarketOS
	- other languages than english difficult to install (need to install the `*-lang` specific packages)
	- package manager has very few features
	- repos lack `gnome-todo`
	- slower than Mobian
- Manjaro ARM
	- nice out-of-the-box theme (thanks to the papirus icon theme)
	- too much preinstalled apps
	- no installer so no support for full-disk encryption
	- slower than Mobian
